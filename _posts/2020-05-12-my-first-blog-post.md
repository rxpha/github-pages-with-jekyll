Hi guys
My name is Raphael, and you should asking 'wh...' nothing, why would you ask anything?
This is my first post on my PAGE at GitHub. I'm very excited but a little upset too. I like blogging and create stuff.. 
But there are a lot of st\*pid rules on my job about browsing and mess around on internet, certainly to avoid people do what I'm doing right now.
So I can't express myself so freely, but as well as I'm writing in English, and using Git posts no one will question me.

_I'm working at office and there's a few tickets to me. In the future I'll explain more about my work and what I do._
